agent/prompt.py — System-prompt assembly for the streaming agent loop.

This module owns ``_build_system_prompt``, which was extracted from the
monolithic ``src/agent_loop.py`` in ODY-70 to reduce coupling and lower
cyclomatic complexity.  The large prompt constants (``TOOL_SECTIONS``,
``_AGENT_RULES``, ``_build_base_prompt``, etc.) remain in
``src/agent_loop.py`` temporarily (P2.2 will move them here).
